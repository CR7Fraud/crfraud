                        Welcome to the portal dedicated to sports truth. This site is born from a commitment to critical
                        analysis, solid statistical data, and fair comparisons between athletes to expose the reality
                        behind Cristiano Ronaldo's career.
                        <br><br>
                        The goal is to demystify titles, awards, and controversial decisions, transparently showing that
                        many achievements attributed to Ronaldo go far beyond individual merit. Here we explore external
                        situations, favoritism, questionable administrative decisions, regulation manipulation, and
                        behind-the-scenes events that helped create an image of success often misaligned with the facts.
                        <br><br>
                        Nothing here is based on fanaticism or biased opinions: every argument is built on real numbers,
                        verified episodes, and historical events, without the filters of media narrative or idolatry.
                        Everything exposed is undeniable - 100% true, logical, and supported by evidence visible to all,
                        though often ignored in common debates.
                        <br><br>
                        The mission of this project is to open people's eyes, awaken critical awareness, and encourage
                        everyone to question the modern football system and athlete recognition. The content presented
                        makes irrefutable the reality about Ronaldo: titles, trophies, and prestige obtained without
                        real justification, and the deconstruction of a farce built over the years.
                        <br><br>
                        I will also ensure that everyone sees that Lionel Messi is light years ahead, and that Ronaldo
                        shouldn't even be in the world's top 3 of history. The pure truth, free from fanaticism and
                        interests, will be revealed here with facts, numbers, and analyses that leave no doubt.
                        <br><br>
                        Reject illusions and reflect on sports justice. This portal invites you to see the facts, far
                        from blind beliefs or external interests - because truth alone is enough.

                                        Ronaldo won his second Ballon d'Or in 2013, with the extraordinary record of

                                        Meanwhile, the other two nominees (Messi and Ribéry) won several trophies and

                                        For the national team, in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, he wasn't the top
                                        scorer in
                                        the group stage (27th place, 8 matches, 4 goals) nor in the playoffs (2 matches,

                                        Ronaldo was only truly decisive in the playoffs, scoring a hat-trick against

                                        to qualify Portugal for the 2014 World Cup.

                                        -
                                        right up to the Portugal vs Sweden game.
                                        Strange, isn't it? It seemed the eligibility period was stretched just to give
                                        Ronaldo credit for those crucial goals.
                                        <br><br>
                                        How did Ronaldo win that Ballon d’Or? It could have gone to Ribéry or Messi,
                                        since
                                        both had years full of achievements and good stats, but the award went to
                                        someone
                                        who won nothing.<br><br>
                                        Did he win it just because of his 69 goals? If that’s the case, it makes no
                                        sense -
                                        that’s what the Golden Boot is for.

                                        2014 was another year full of <strong>controversy</strong> about Ronaldo winning
                                        the
                                        Ballon d'Or – and it is indeed debatable.<br><br>

                                        Still, it would have been tough for Messi to win because Ronaldo had better
                                        numbers,
                                        was the <strong>Champions League top scorer</strong>, broke the goals record,
                                        won
                                        the Spanish Cup, La Liga, and the Champions League.<br><br>
                                        But in third place, Neuer was the world’s best goalkeeper that year, winning the
                                        league, cup, super cup, reaching the Champions League semifinals, and winning
                                        the
                                        2014 World Cup (as <strong>best goalkeeper</strong>).<br><br>
                                        So the controversy is that Ronaldo just had better numbers, winning the
                                        Champions
                                        League best player and top scorer awards solely because of goals.<br>
                                        That Real Madrid team had other key players making much bigger impacts: Gareth
                                        Bale
                                        was more decisive in the Champions League and King’s Cup finals, Sergio Ramos
                                        scored
                                        a vital goal in the Champions final, and Di María won man of the match in that
                                        final. Sure, Ronaldo scored as well - from the penalty spot 😂 - so he was
                                        clearly
                                        <strong>not the main figure</strong>. And let’s not mention the disastrous World
                                        Cup
                                        campaign for Portugal, which ended at the group stage in a group with Ghana and

                                        Did Ronaldo deserve this Ballon d'Or? Neuer was <strong>more important</strong>
                                        and
                                        won the whole World Cup (except for the Champions League) and did it as the top
                                        goalkeeper. Messi was the best player at the World Cup and had a strong year
                                        stats-wise.<br>
                                        Ronaldo was <strong>not decisive</strong>, with the whole Real Madrid team
                                        deserving
                                        merit, and he was eliminated at the World Cup group stage.<br><br>
                                        So it matters a lot: Neuer was the key man and <strong>best goalkeeper in all
                                            competitions</strong> and at the World Cup. Messi was the best player at the
                                        World Cup.<br>
                                        Ronaldo? He was just <strong>"another" player to win the Champions
                                            League</strong>,
                                        with Di María as MVP in the final and the rest having crucial roles. Sure, he
                                        scored
                                        a lot, but what about those who created those plays? <strong>Golden Boot ≠
                                            Ballon
                                            d’Or</strong>.<br><br>
                                        Messi was unlucky that year - maybe if he had won the league and/or the World
                                        Cup it
                                        would have been different. I think Neuer deserved it too, at least it is
                                        understandable.

                                        and Euro 2016… but let’s look at the stats and facts.<br><br>
                                        Real Madrid won the Champions League again (rigged? topic for another article).
                                        Ronaldo scored 16 goals in the Champions League, with 11 in the group stage
                                        against
                                        Malmö and Shakhtar.<br>

                                        In Euro 2016, Ronaldo missed a penalty against Austria and Portugal had a poor

                                        He showed up against Hungary (2 goals) and Wales (1 goal). In the final versus
                                        France, he left injured after 25 minutes, and Portugal still won 1-0.<br><br>
                                        The Euro’s best player was Antoine Griezmann. It’s always the same pattern:

                                        is rarely the main figure at major tournaments.

                                        <strong>La Liga</strong> and the <strong>cup</strong>, reached the <strong>Copa

                                        So why did Ronaldo win the Ballon d'Or? Mostly for team trophies-Champions

                                        and Euros-while Messi was not only super important in Copa America and the
                                        league
                                        with 91 g/a (goals and assists), but arguably better on individual merit.<br>
                                        Ronaldo wasn’t the key player. His Ballon d’Or was based on important team
                                        trophies,
                                        but he was not the best on the pitch. Messi stood out in all competitions.

                        <h3>2017</h3>
                        <p>
                            Both had good seasons, <b>Messi</b> won the best player trophy at one or more awarding
                            organizations (like Spanish Sports Newspaper <b>Marca</b>, etc..), won the <strong>IFFHS
                                best playmaker award</strong>, and win the <strong>Golden Boot</strong> but only win the
                            Spanish Cup. <br><br>Even though Real Madrid had another suspicious Champions League
                            (discussed elsewhere), <b>Ronaldo</b> scored more in the Champions League including two in
                            the final, <strong>won the Champions League</strong>, <strong>La Liga</strong>,
                            <strong>Spanish Supercup</strong>, <strong>European Supercup</strong>, and<strong> Club
                                World Cup</strong>, and had almost as many goals as Messi but won more titles. <br><br>
                            Messi stood out a bit more for goals and assists, but <strong>Ronaldo won so many
                                trophies</strong> it was hard not to give it to him-it was a <strong>good season for
                                both</strong>.

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>
                            This says a lot about their careers~, without Real Madrid and its suspicious Champions
                            League campaigns, Ronaldo would have at least half the Ballon d'Ors he owns-and that's
                            discussed later in the "Champions League" section. <br><br> Messi has always been the more
                            complete player, with as <strong>many or more goals than Ronaldo</strong>, more
                            <strong>Golden Boots</strong> even though Ronaldo played more time as a striker (Messi
                            almost never did), <strong>more assists</strong>, more <strong>best player awards</strong>.
                            <br><br> Ronaldo only stands out for the Champions League and Champions League top scorer
                            awards-all of this across his first and last Ballon d’Or.
